# Q17.3 - more than an audiophile approach to perfect sound


Q17.3 is a continuation of the Q17 class B amplifier based on current dumping principle.<br>

For STEREO or MULTICHANNEL multiply the order with the same parts. <br>

What is new ? <br>
Operational was changed to OPA828. This is one of the few SiGe device on the market with terrific performance and most important, sound exceptionally well.
Current mirror was recplaced with NCD7003P. This have 2 matched p-mos transistors on same substrate with same thermal Vgs deviation.<br>
Furthermore, the current mirror was upgraded to a Wilson one. This improve mirros stability and operation at high frequncy.
In an atempt to make the amplifier more "popular", I have adopted well known parts as 2N4401/2N4403 and 2N5551/2N5401. These are widely available from a wide range of manufacturers.
First stage after OPA828 is now a Borbely cascode, made with a well known jfet LSK170B and a depletion mosfet DN2535/DN2540. 
In addition, R10 and R13 have been reduced to 9R1.

Thank you for reading ! <br>
If you have built this amplifier I would love to see your Q17 implementation. :-) <br>
<br>
Many thankd to St√©phane @stefaweb for taking the time to build and test Q17.3
